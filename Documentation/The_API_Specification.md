The API specification consists of two parts.  

* The `Types` section describes the data types that are available for the resources. The figure below shows an overview of the resource objects and there relations.  
_Note 1_: The `Types` section in this main RAML file actually is empty. It includes the various type files in the `Libraries` directory.  
_Note 2_: Currently, the generated HTML documentation does not contain tables that describe the data types. However, their content can be seen in the response tabs of the requests. If you want to have a detailed look at the type definitions, open the RAML files in the `Libraries` directory.
* The `/dd/2.0` resources section describes the available end-points.

`Todo: Complete the documentation of the various query parameters and the various attributes of the resource objects. Can be partly taken over from the 1.0 specs.`

See the figure below for an overview of the various resource objects and their relations.
