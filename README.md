# Digital Delta web service API specification version 2.0
Version 2.0 of the Digital Delta API builds on the foundation as specified in [version 1.0](https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-api-spec/blob/master/README.md).
The main new feature of version 2.0 is the addition of Aspects sets to allow expectations and predictions to be retrieved.

Due to the nature of the changes, version 2.0 is not backwards compatible with version 1.0.
The status of this specification is **draft**.

The [Generic version 2.0](dd.v20.raml) of the specification is the 'general purpose' specification.

The [Operations version 2.0](dd-oper.v20.raml) is a specific version developed for/by Rijkswaterstaat, designed to retrieve data using fixed, strict paths, with the purpose to be able to cache request/responses and to act as an intermediary.
