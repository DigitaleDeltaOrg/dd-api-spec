<h1 id="digitaldeltaapispecificationversion20">Digital Delta API Specification Version 2.0</h1>

<p>This specification describes the Digital Delta API Version 2.0 (DD-API 2.0). It is meant for both implementers and consumers of the Digital Delta API specifications.</p>

<h2 id="aboutthedigitaldelta20specification">About the Digital Delta 2.0 specification</h2>

<p>Version 2.0 of the Digital Delta API builds on the foundation as specified in <a href="https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-api-spec/blob/master/README.md">version 1.0</a>.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://www.digitaldelta.nu/en/phase-3-operational-phase/item340">Digital Delta project</a> for some background information.</p>

<p>The changes in version 2.0 compared to 1.0 can be summarized as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Renaming of some attributes, e.g. for consistency reasons, or to clarify the content of the attribute</li>

<li>Adjusting some resource object types in the response in order to let them adhere better to standards. For instance, the Location objects now is a GeoJSON object) and the paging information has been re-arranged according the DSO API guidelines.</li>

<li>Adding attributes to the Timeseries object that facilitate the definition of computation results and ensemble runs.</li>

<li>Adding interval information to the values in a Timeseries</li>

<li>Adding the concept of aspect sets, a mechanism to group related time series, e.g. the minimum, maximum and average of a measured quantity, or the direction and amplitude of wave field.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Due to the nature of the changes, version 2.0 is not backwards compatible with version 1.0.</em>  </p>

<p>The status of this specification is <strong>pre-production</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting started</h2>

<p>The specification is written in <a href="https://raml.org">RAML 1.0</a>, a 'language' to define <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> (REpresentational State Transfer) service.</p>

<p>It is a <em>specification</em>. This means that there is no full implementation of this specification available in this repository.
There are, however, <a href="https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-api-spec/tree/2.0/examples">result samples</a> available. Some <a href="https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-api-spec/wiki/C%23-Generic-Base-Classes-for-DD-API-2.0">helper classes</a> in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/index">C# programming language</a> are available in the <a href="https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-api-spec/wiki">Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>To read the RAML specification, some <a href="https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-api-specs/wiki/Tools">tools</a> are recommended. Some tools are also capable of generating documentation, or code skeletons for both consumers and implementers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-api-spec/blob/2.0/dd.v20.html">HTML specifications</a> can also be used and may be easier to read.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>The easiest way to get the specification is to download the generated HTML files.
To be able to use the RAML files, please consult the <a href="https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-api-spec/wiki/Tools">tools</a> section. Knowledge of the <a href="https://raml.org">RAML language</a> is then recommended.</p>

<h2 id="thespecification">The specification</h2>

<p>Version 2.0 includes two specifications.
The generic <a href="dd.v20.raml">DD-API version 2.0</a> of the specification is the 'general purpose' specification, with url's that facilitate both searching for and retrieving data. Hence it both for discovery and for getting data.</p>

<p>The <a href="dd-oper.v20.raml">Operational extension "dd-oper"</a> is an extension developed for/by Rijkswaterstaat, designed to retrieve data using a fixed strict url-path. It only differs from the generic version in the url-syntax. The dd-oper-url does not support discovery.</p>

<p>The changes between version 1.0 and 2.0 are described <a href="https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-api-spec/blob/2.0/Documentation/Changes_between_1.0_and_2.0.md">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="implementations">Implementations</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-api-spec/wiki/Current-implementations">Current Implementations</a> contains the most recent list of implementations of the Digital Delta Specifications. </p>
